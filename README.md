simplelogin
===========

Simple basic register/login script created with php, there are safer options out there I think, but this is just so simple :)
This created by a first year IT student, who does not know anything about optimalization or security, so keep that in mind.
There could be some really bad pieces of code inhere, but I just do not really know the right way to do it. If you have suggestions I really would like to hear them. Feedback is always appreciated  :)

Also, about license and stuff:
I am to lazy to find a right way to put it atm, so:

Use it however you like! Its free for ever! If you want, you can put my name on your website, or give me a link to your website if you use my scripts, i would always appreciate that!
